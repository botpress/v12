## Environment Variables

Most of these variables can be set in the configuration file `data/global/botpress.config.json`.

Infrastructure configuration (such as the database, cluster mode, etc.) isn't available in the configuration file, since it'ss required before the config is loaded.

Botpress supports `.env` files, so you don't have to set them every time you start the app. Save the file in the same folder as the executable.

### Common Variables

| Environment Variable | Description                                                                          | Default            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| `PORT`               | Sets the port that Botpress will listen to.                                          | `3000`             |
| `BP_HOST`            | The host to check for incoming connections.                                          | `localhost`        |
| `EXTERNAL_URL`       | This is the external URL that users type in the address bar to talk with the bot.    | `http://HOST:PORT` |
| `DATABASE_URL`       | Full connection string to connect to the DB. For Postgres, start with `postgres://`. | -                  |
| `BP_PRODUCTION`      | Sets Botpress in production mode. This has the same effect as starting it with `-p`. | `false`            |
| `BPFS_STORAGE`       | Storage destination used by BPFS to read and write files (global and bots).          | `disk`             |
| `PRO_ENABLED`        | Enables the pro version of Botpress, the license key will be required.               | `false`            |
| `BP_LICENSE_KEY`     | Your license key (can also be specified in `botpress.config.json`).                  | -                  |
| `CLUSTER_ENABLED`    | Enables multi-node support using Redis.                                              | `false`            |
| `REDIS_URL`          | The connection string to connect to your Redis instance.                             | -                  |
| `AUTO_MIGRATE`       | Automatically migrates bots up to the running Botpress version.                      | -                  |
| `DEBUG`              | Namespaces to [debug](#advanced-logging).                                            | -                  |

### Runtime and Modules

| Environment Variable        | Description                                                                                  | Default |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `VERBOSITY_LEVEL`           | Botpress will be more chatty when processing requests. This has the same effects as `-v`.    |         |
| `BP_DECISION_MIN_CONFIENCE` | Sets the minimum threshold required for the Decision Engine to elect a suggestion.           | `0.5`   |
| `FAST_TEXT_VERBOSITY`       | Define the level of verbosity that FastText will use when training models.                   | `0`     |
| `FAST_TEXT_CLEANUP_MS`      | The model will be kept in memory until it receives no messages to process for that duration. | `60000` |
| `REVERSE_PROXY`             | When enabled, it uses "x-forwarded-for" to fetch the user IP instead of remoteAddress.       | `false` |

It is also possible to use environment variables to override module configuration. The pattern is `BP_MODULE_%MODULE_NAME%_%OPTION_PATH%`, all in upper case. For example, to define the `languageSources` option of the module `nlu`, you would use `BP_MODULE_NLU_LANGUAGESOURCES`.

:::tip
You can list the available environment variables for each module by enabling the `DEBUG=bp:configuration:modules:*` flag.
